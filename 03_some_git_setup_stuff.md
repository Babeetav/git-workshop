# Some git setup stuff

Here are some commands you should run when first setting up git:

```sh
# <- lines starting with a '#' are comments. Don't type them.

# Tell git your name and email address. These will be written into your commits
#  and they will be visible publicly. Replace contents accordingly.

git config --global user.name "Jay Smith"
git config --global user.email "jsmith@example.com"
```

## Command lines

If you are not used to command lines, the following will be of use to you

* `pwd` - show what folder you are in
* `ls` - show the contents of the folder you are in
  * `ls FOLDER` - show the contents of the folder you name
* `cd FOLDER` - go into a folder

The Bash command environment (distributed with Git Bash, and default in many Linux systems) is very versatile. You can get comfortable with it in less than a day :-)
