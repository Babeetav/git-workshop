# How to find projects to contribute to

Look around at the projects you already use! It's probably no use trying to contribute to a project "just because."

If there's a Python, NPM, Ruby, etc library you already use, is there a way to make it better? Check to see if it's on Github or any other hosting site, and look to work with it.

There's a good guide on learning how to best make contributions <https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/>

But remember, contributions aren't just code!

* Translations are important. If the project has a translation framework, see if you can add/improve the languages - including the project's native language!
* Documentation is also important - many projects host their documentation set in a dedicated repository, ready for contribution
* Answering questions on the forum also helps a lot. Dedicated forums and Stack Overflow are the best places to help people use an open source project you enjoy (no PRs for this though!)
* Testing - you can kick the tyres on a project, or rigourously test it too. If fixing the code is too complex for you, rasing an issue in the bug tracker is also helpful! Be structured, be verbose, describe exactly how to repoduce the bug, and follow up any questions promptly.
* Documentation bugs are also a thing!

Keep that in mind, and you're on your way to being a great contributor to the projects you care about!
