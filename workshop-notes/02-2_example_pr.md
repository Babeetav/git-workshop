# Example of a PR

You can see an example PR I did on the LXC project.

<https://github.com/lxc/lxc/pull/1473>

It has an example of

* a description and reason for raising the PR
* an automated check that the original project had set up
* a comment from the original maintainer requesting a fix
* and its acceptance
