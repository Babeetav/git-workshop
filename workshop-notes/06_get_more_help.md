There are many resources for learning git online.

A good place to start is the official Git Getting-Started guide (links below)

A longer course in the context of making mods for [Minetest](https://minetest.net) is available on YouTube. It introduces the same concepts as covered in this workshop, as well as programming concepts in Lua.

An even more comprehensive and professional course is provided by the Software Carpentry site

You can search Google and Stack Overflow to see if your question has been asked before (it probably has)

Finally if you want somewhere to ask questions and get answers interactively from me, use the Git channel on Riot.im, or raise an issue on the main git-workshop repo
