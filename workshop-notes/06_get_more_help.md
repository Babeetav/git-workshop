There are many resources for learning git online.

A good place to start is the official Git Getting-Started guide (links below)

A longer course in the context of making mods for Minetest is available on YouTube. It introduces the same concepts as covered in this workshop, as well as programming concepts in Lua.

You can search Google and Stack Overflow to see if your question has been asked before (it probably has)

Finally if you want somewhere to ask questions and get answers interactively from me, use the Git channel on Riot.im, created for this workshop :-)
