## Create a repo

On github.com, create a new repository. Give it a name, and a short description. Initialise with a `README.md` where prompted.

## Clone the repo

Say for example your repository is at `https://github.com/jsmith/my-repo`

In your command environment, do

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jsmith/my-repo

cd my-repo
```

## Edit the readme

The readme file is just a text file. Open it in your text editor.
