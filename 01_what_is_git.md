# Git & Github Introduction

# What is `git` ?

> Git allows you to track changes in a folder full of files, and maintain a secure, verifiable history.

Git is a "source code management" tool (SCM). It tracks the differences and changes of code over time, to allow developers to see code's history, and consult or retrieve old versions if things go awry. Git is just one of many SCMs available, but by far the most popular currently, especially in open source development.

One of its most notable features is that it is a "decentralised" SCM: it can send its data to a central server, like Github, but it does not need to - it is self contained. Other SCMs like SVN need a dedicated server to work.
