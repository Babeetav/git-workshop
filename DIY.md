# Host a workshop!

You are welcome to use this workshop content as a foundation for your own introduction to github in your company, study group, or coding team.

To do so:

* Fork this repository into your own space on Github
* Clone the repository locally
    * `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/git-workshop`
    * `cd git-workshop`
* Do a hard reset to version 1.1.0
    * `git reset --hard v1.1.0`
* Change the main URLs in the example in `workshop-notes/05_guided_course.md`
    * The ones referring to the `taikedz` repository should be changed to match your namespace
    * Then `add`, and `commit` your changes
* Then push it back to your repository, using `--force` to overwrite the old master state
    * `git push --force`

You are now ready to run the workshop yourself! And if you develop a new way of running the workshop, we'd love to hear your feedback!
