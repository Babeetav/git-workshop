# Host a workshop!

You are welcome to use this workshop content as a foundation for your own introduction to github in your study group, community or among coding friends.

To do so:

* Fork this repository into your own space on Github
* Clone the repository locally
    * `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/git-workshop`
    * `cd git-workshop`
* Do a hard reset to version 1.0.3
    * `git reset --hard v1.0.3`
* Then push it back overwriting the old master state
    * `git push --force`

You are now ready to run the workshop yourself! And if you develop a new way of running the workshop, we'd love to hear your feedback!
