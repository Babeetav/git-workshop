# What is Github ?

Github is a website where people can upload their source code repositories, and view and the changes they track using the `git` source control tool. It is very popular in the open source world - it is where nearly all projects store their code openly. Other sites like Gitlab.com and Bitbucket.com function in a similar way.

The most notable feature of Github is what is called "forking." You can make a copy of somebody else's public code into your own account, and work on it separately from the official copy. When you are ready, you can send a request to the original project to ask them to accept your changes. This process is called a "Pull Request," literally a request to the oroginal code owners to pull in your changes. It is known by its initialism, "PR."

## PR and contribution workflow

When you have found a project you want to contribute to, the following are the general steps to follow:

* Check if they have a `Contributing.md` file that tells you how they expect contributions to be made
* Use the `Fork` feature to create a copy of the code in your own space
* Work on your own copy, and make sure the changes you made work
* In your copy, find the button to "open a pull request" and choose to send your changes to the original project. The `Contributing.md` document should tell you how to do this.
* Wait for the original authors to get back to you. They may have changes they ask for, or ask for clarification on what you have done.
* Once the PR is accepted and merged, you can delete your copy of the code from your online space - not before.

If the change you proposed does not get accepted, don't worry! That change was not desired. Other changes may be more desirable in the future, so keep it up!
